# probability calculator ("prob-calc")
A jupyter notebook full of stats and probability calculation and visualization tools. A prototype of an app to come.  
Current functionality:
* Permutations and Combinations
* Bayesian Probability
* Bayesian probability visualization
* Binomial Probability
* Bernoulli Trials & Bernoulli Process
* Geometric Probability
* Probability Density Function
* P value
* Card game probability

## Todo
* give jupyter notebook a front-end with Voila and ipwidgets libraries
* flesh out AI
* working frontend for web app branch
* mobile app version?

## Current branches
* [branch 1:](https://github.com/Radicool-Solutions-LLC/prob-calc/tree/branch_1_(backend-attempt)) WIP attempt to make a backend for a web app.
* [AI branch:](https://github.com/Radicool-Solutions-LLC/prob-calc/tree/AI_branch) WIP. A small NLP AI program to determine what kind of probability problem you have, assuming it falls within the categories listed previously.
