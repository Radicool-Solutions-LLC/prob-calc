# probability-calculator (AI branch)
Small NLP AI trained to determine what kind of probability problem you have. WIP.  
Categories detectable by AI:
* Permutations and Combinations
* Bayesian Probability
* Binomial related categories (Binomial Probability, Bernoulli Process, Geometric Probability)
* Probability Density Function
* P value
* vague probability and non-probability questions

# to-do:
* Flesh out AI
  * Integrate an existing small LLM?
  *  make it determine subcategories of P&C and binomial probability later
  *  sends function calls to calculator & visualization functions
* add to main branch when done
