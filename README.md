# probability-calculator
A jupyter notebook full of stats and probability calculation and visualization tools. A handy guide for the backend functionality of this program. Converted to a .py file for backend functionality. Front-end WIP.
**Functions:**
* Permutations and Combinations
* Bayesian Probability
* Bayesian probability visualization
* Binomial Probability
* Bernoulli Trials & Bernoulli Process
* Geometric Probability
* Probability Density Function
* P value
* Card game probability

# to-do:
* train a small LLM to determine what kind of probability problem you're facing and run the proper function in the backend
* front-end
