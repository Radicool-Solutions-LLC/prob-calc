# probability calculator (web app version)
An easy to use and understand probability calculator with visualizations. Makes it way easy to digest probability concepts. 

## Front-end
Currently on vercel! Check it out [here (WIP)](https://v0-prob-calc-version-1-1.vercel.app/)
* to see the frontend source code, click [here.](https://vercel.com/radicool-solutions-projects/v0-prob-calc-version-1-1/C7xihfvTs8ECnZAX9YTc7mNmHQcj/source)

## backend
Current functionality
* Permutations and Combinations
* Bayesian Probability
* Bayesian probability visualization
* Binomial Probability
* Bernoulli Trials & Bernoulli Process
* Geometric Probability
* Probability Density Function
* P value
* Card game probability
   
## jupyter notebook
Acts as a handy and easy to use guide for the backend functionality of this program.

# to-do:
* front-end: make graphs and visualizations work. May need to rewrite all visualization code in typescript. 
* AI (track development on the AI branch)
