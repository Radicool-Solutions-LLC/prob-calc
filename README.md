# probability calculator ("prob-calc")
A jupyter notebook full of stats and probability calculation and visualization tools. Easy to use and understand. Makes it way easier to digest probability concepts.  
**Now with a GUI!** Download it, or use it online at [mybinder.org](https://hub.2i2c.mybinder.org/user/radicool-solutions-llc-prob-calc-8ht90hq6/doc/tree/probability%20calculator%20functions.ipynb) (password: `statscalc`)
  
**Current functions:**  
* Permutations and Combinations
* Bayesian Probability
* Bayesian probability visualization
* Binomial Probability
* Bernoulli Trials & Bernoulli Process
* Geometric Probability
* Probability Density Function
* P value
* Card game probability (monte carlo simulation for poker)

**Files:**  
* probability calculator functions.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the GUI
* Prob calculator examples (no gui or viola).ipynb: original version without GUI. 
* "static" folder: svg icons for the GUI.
* requirements.txt: required for mybinder online jupyter notebook environment. Not required if you've downloaded it and are just using it locally.

## Todo
* more card game functionality
* flesh out & implement AI (track progress in AI branch)
* mobile app version?

## Current branches
* [Webapp branch:](https://github.com/Radicool-Solutions-LLC/prob-calc/tree/branch_1_(webapp-attempt)) WIP attempt to make a web app with GUI. Working on making visualizations work.
	* [Available here](https://v0-prob-calc-version-1-1.vercel.app/), *but I recommend using the jupyter notebook version found on this branch instead.*  
	
* [AI branch:](https://github.com/Radicool-Solutions-LLC/prob-calc/tree/AI_stuff) WIP. A small NLP AI program to determine what kind of probability problem you have (assuming it falls within the categories listed previously)
